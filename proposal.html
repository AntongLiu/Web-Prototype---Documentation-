			<h2>Background</h2>
      <h3 id="topic">The topic</h3>
			<p>The theme of the proposal is to design a website for an Australian charity and non-profit organization called Clean Up Australia Limited to support and promote their cause and provide the public with a way to sign up and support the charity. 
      
</p>
			<h3 id="research">Background Research</h3>
			<p>According to Wikipedia (2020), <strong> Clean Up Australia Limited</strong> is an Australian charity and non-profit environmental protection organization founded by Ian Kiernan and Kim McKay in 1989. This organization is committed to promoting relationships between communities, businesses and governments to solve many existing environmental issues such as waste, water and climate change. </p> 
      <p>Gillaspy (2013) pointed out that since the Industrial Revolution, along with the rapid development of industrialization, urbanization and the swiftly promoted social productivity,  the advancement of civilization and the expansion of the scale of cities have been accelerated. However, at the same time, many global problems such as population growth, excessive consumption of resources, environmental pollution and ecological destruction have become increasingly prominent, which have seriously hindered the long-term development of human society and the improvement of the quality of life. In Australia, environmental problems are mainly manifested in land desertification, surface and ground water pollution, air pollution, floods and devastating bushfires. (Hobday & McDonald, 2014)</p> 
      <p>In Wikipedia (2020), ENGO (environmental non-governmental organization) can be defined as a non-governmental organization (NGO) in the field of environmentalism.These organizations operate on a global scale and play an important role in dealing with various environmental problems occurring in the world today. However, most of the existing environmental protection organizations are small in scale, weak in ability, lack of competition, which makes it difficult for them to respond effectively to environmental issues. Among the 1000 environmental protection public welfare organizations, less than 400 are active, and few of them can play a leading role in leading public topics. (Becker, 2016)

			<h3 id="#need">The Needs</h3>
			<p>In order to enable the public to participate more actively in environmental protection, the first step is to provide them with relevant environmental information. The website needs to realize the functions of allowing people to understand the basic knowledge and regulations related to environmental protection. In addition, the website should be updated in real time with major international news related to environmental protection. Moreover, the website should act as a bridge for communication between caring people, and regularly organize environmental protection activities. Finally, the website can also be used as a way to raise donations to relieve the huge pressure on the operation of the Non-Profit organizations. The goal of designing this website is to promote an environmentally friendly public welfare organization that can match the scale and quality of Australia’s current economic and social development.</p>

      <h3 id="#target group">The Target Group</h3>
      <p>As a complex social system engineering, environmental protection  can not be separated with the majority of the joint efforts of  the public, environmental protection groups and the government. As a result, the target users of the website are of all ages and occupations, such as environmental protection organizations, enterprises, schools, governments and individuals. Each type of users care about different content, which requires a clear definition of the navigation column of the website, so that users can quickly find the content they care about.</p>

      <h3 id="#inspiration">Inspiration</h3>
      <figure>
				<img src="img/National Association for Environmental Education.png" alt="National Association for Environmental Education"/>
        <p>The choice of color makes websites appear more credible to a user. Each branch in the navigation bar has a picture description, which is easier for visitors to understand and will attract their attention.</p>
      </figure>
       <figure>
				<img src="img/Energy Saving Trust.png" alt="Energy Saving Trust"/>
        <p>Because the website mainly focuses on environmental protection actions with the family as a unit, warm yellow and white are used as the theme colors on the homepage to give people a warm feeling. However, in other modules, the main color will change according to the theme. For example, in the business module, the website uses dark blue as the main color, giving people a formal and rigorous feeling.</p>
      </figure>
      <figure>
				<img src="img/Friends of the Earth.png" alt="Friends of the Earth"/>
        <p>The color on this website is green tones, which gives people a natural and environment-friendly feeling before browsing the text content in the website. Besides, at the top of each module, there is a slogan in large font to better convey the information the website wants to express.</p>
      </figure>
			
			<h3 id="sketches">Sketches</h3>
			<figure>
				<img src="img/homepage1.png" border="3" alt="homepage"/>
        <p>The navigation column should be arranged from front to back according to the expected estimated number of clicks; and the content of the main page should be arranged according to the daily user’s visiting and operating habits.</p>
      </figure>
			<figure>
				<img src="img/homepage2.png" border="3" alt="homepage"/>
       </figure>
       <figure>
				<img src="img/About Us.png" border="3"/>
        <p>Chandra (2017) point that the About Us page is one of the most important pages on the website. This is an opportunity for visitors to learn about the organization, and a good About Us page could increase the credibility of the organization.</p>
      </figure>
       <figure>
				<img src="img/Environmental issues.png" border="3"/>
        <p>By introducing existing environmental issues, visitors can realize the seriousness of the problem and begin to attach importance to and actively participate in environmental protection.</p>
      </figure>
      <figure>
				<img src="img/what could we do.png" border="3"/>
        <p>The topic of environmental protection should be close to the daily life of the audience in order to improve the participation of them.</p>
      </figure>
      <figure>
				<img src="img/GET INVOLVED.png" border="3"/>
        <p>According to the financial overview report of Clean Up Australia Limited issued by Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission (2020), the organization’s income from donations and bequests accounts for more than 17% of its total revenue, second to government grants.</p>
      </figure>
      <h3 id="img/web site map">Web Site Map</h3>
      By interviewing five respondents, the navigation bar was reordered according to feedback.
      <blockquote>
			<p>	“I never click on the ‘about us’ page, because I feel that the content of this column is usually too official and can’t get useful information from it.”</p>
      <p align="right">--Victor</p>
      <p>“When I browse a charity website, ‘what can we do’ is my most concerned part.</P> <p align="right">--Colleen </p>
      <p>“I’m used to browsing the home page first. I like websites with visual impact.”</P> <p align="right">--Milla</P>
			</blockquote>
      <figure>
				<img src="img/Web Site Map.jpg" border="3"/>
      </figure>

      <h3 id="website style">The Website style</h3>
      <p>The website colors I choose for Clean Up Australia Limited I choose are mainly warm green with the white background colour. Good color matching can play a positive impact in building  up website and brand image to a certain extent, since color has a strong psychological impact on people’s behavior and decision-making. (Wharton, 2019)</p>
      <p>White is the most common color used on websites. Some websites even reserve a large area of blank space as an integral part of the website, which gives visitors a space for reverie, making the whole page clean and clear, and making people feel comfortable.</p>
      <p>According to Wharton’s report (2019), green is considered to be the dominant color in nature. People always associate green colour with lives, peace and nature. Moreover, this colour could bring people a sense of fullness. Green is a mixture of the two primary colors of blue and yellow. Blue is usually used to create a sense of security and trust in the brand. Yellow represents optimism and youth, and is usually used to attract people’s attention.</p>

        <p>The first impression is very important, which is why the homepage is the most aesthetically needed design on the website. Start by answering clearly “who am I”, “what do I do” and/or “what can you (visitor) do here”.</p>
